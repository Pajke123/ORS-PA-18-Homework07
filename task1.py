===================   TASK 1   ====================
* Name: Roll The Dice
*
* Write a script that will simulate rolling the
* dice. The script should fetch the number of times
* the dice should be "rolled" as user input.
* At the end, the script should print how many times
* each number appeared (1 - 6).
*
* Note: Please describe in details possible cases
* in which your solution might not work.
*
* Note: You can use `rand` module to simulate dice
* rolling.
